16. june 2002 v1.04
---------------------
Fixed a small portability problem that assumed that an int was at
least 32-bit. The C/C++ only requires it to be 16-bit.

24. may 2002 v1.03
---------------------
Added example of use. The example requires GLUT to compile and run. 
A win32 binary is provided. 
The C and C++ versions of this library has now been merged into one
distribution.

22. feb 2002 v1.02
---------------------
Fixed a minor compilation error when the BMP loader was used
on Windows but without GLUT. If this happened the BI_RLE4,
BI_RGB and BI_RLE8 constants was already defined. I fixed this
by changing the names of the constants to BMP_BI_RLE4,
BMP_BI_RGB and BMP_BI_RLE8 respectively. Thanks to
spiff (spiff@virginia.edu) for reporting this bug.
